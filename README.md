LeapCopter
==========

Control your quadcopter with LeapMotion controller and the a7105 chip.

You must have Processing and Arduino environment installed.

Pull the a7105 file on the arduino ( i'm using an arduino DUE for the 3.3V output on pins). 

Wiring are in the main.ino file.

After a7105 is pulled on the arduino, just open the LeapCopter.pde file, click on the "run" button, THEN power on your quad.

Controls : 0 to switch control on/off, 1 to switch between Leap mode and keyboard mode, 2 to switch stabilisation on/off.
Keyboard mode : A = throttle up, Z = throttle down. Right, left, up and down keys to control aileron and elevator.
Leap mode : incline your hand left/right/backwards/forwards to make the quad move left/right/backwards/forward. Close your hand for self landing. Flips not included yet.

Enjoy !!!
